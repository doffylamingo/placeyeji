## How to bless your frontend

Put Yeji in your image tag. It's that easy.

```html
<img src="https://placeyeji.vercel.app/image?w=500&h=750" />
```

Looks good. Because it’s Yeji.

Don’t feel like setting a height? No worries — if you skip the `h` parameter, we’ll just use the width you gave.
Perfect squares, effortless Yeji.
